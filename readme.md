**01 Project Overview and Objectives**


1.1 What is the main goal of the project?

The main goal of the project is to re-design and enhance the Wedding section of the website to include a booking system for an administrator to track and manage bookings and registered users. A user should be able to to select an available date from a form with a calendar and submit a booking request. Once the Administrator then logs in a dashboard should be displayed with booking requests and the option to capture the users details. This should ensure a smooth booking process for users and provides admins with a dashboard to manage and confirm bookings.

After the booking is confirmed, users can register to create an account. This will involve a registration form that captures basic details like name, email, and password. A Profile page will then allow the users to manage their wedding RSVP.The admin dashboard will also includes the ability to view RSVP statuses, guest counts, and meal preferences. Admins can export this data to manage seating arrangements and catering.The system will provide a full-service platform for wedding guest management, from booking to RSVP tracking and meal preferences, with a secure admin dashboard to streamline event logistics. It simplifies communication between the wedding organiser and guests while ensuring accurate, real-time information to support the event planning process.



1.2 Who are the target users, and what are their needs?

The target users for the wedding booking and RSVP management system can be divided into two main groups: wedding guests and administrators (wedding organisers). Each group has specific needs based on their roles.By addressing the below needs, the system will create a seamless experience for both guests and administrators.

1.2.1 Wedding Guests (Users)
Needs:
Easy Booking Process: Guests want a simple and user-friendly way to select a wedding date and confirm their attendance.
Account Management: After booking, they need a way to create and manage their profile, update their RSVP status, and make adjustments to their guest count or food preferences (e.g., dietary restrictions, meal choices).
Convenient Communication: Guests may need reminders or updates, such as RSVP deadlines or changes to wedding arrangements.

1.2.2 Administrators (Wedding Organisers or Event Planners)
Needs:
Booking Management: Admins need a dashboard to view all booking requests, track the status (pending, confirmed, rejected), and gather user details like names, guest counts, and meal preferences.
RSVP Tracking: Administrators need to monitor RSVPs, including updates from guests, their attendance status, and food preferences. This helps them with planning seating arrangements, meal orders, and logistics.
User Profile Management: They need access to the guests' profile information in case adjustments are required (e.g., changes in guest count or preferences).
Automation: Automation of reminders and notifications to reduce manual communication for RSVPs and other wedding-related updates.
Security and Access Control: Secure login for the admin to ensure only authorised individuals can access sensitive data (e.g., guest information, bookings).



1.3 What problem does this project aim to solve?
The wedding booking and RSVP management system aims to solve several key problems for both wedding organisers and guests:

1.3.1 For Wedding Organisers (Administrators):
Manual and Time-Consuming RSVP Tracking:
Traditionally, tracking RSVPs, guest preferences, and managing communications can be tedious and prone to errors. This project automates the process, reducing the need for manual follow-up and ensuring up-to-date guest information.

1.3.2 Inconsistent Guest Information:
Organisers often deal with incomplete or inconsistent information (e.g., guest counts, dietary restrictions). This system ensures that guests provide all necessary details (like meal preferences) at the time of RSVP, allowing organisers to access reliable, real-time information.

1.3.3 Difficulty Managing Large Guest Lists:
Managing large guest lists, including their RSVPs, special requests, and meal preferences, becomes complex without the right tools. The project provides a structured dashboard where all guest details are centralised, making it easier to plan and manage the event.

1.3.4 Logistical Planning:
Organisers need accurate data on guest counts and preferences to plan seating, catering, and event logistics. The system simplifies this by providing real-time insights into RSVP numbers and specific guest needs, helping with efficient planning.



**02 Scope and Features**

2.1. Scope and Features

The system will cover the full lifecycle of wedding guest management, from booking and RSVPs to meal preference tracking and administrative oversight. It will cater to both wedding guests and administrators (wedding planners or organisers), ensuring secure and seamless management of guest information, event logistics, and communication.


2.1.1. Booking System (User-Facing)

Please see supporting wireframes 2.3 High-Level Design.drawio



**03 System architecture** 
The architecture and functionality include the client-side (frontend), server-side (backend), database, and the communication flow between these layers. The system will be built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.


3.1. Front-End (React):
The front end will handle the UI, allowing users (guests and admins) to interact with the system.

Key Components:
Booking Form: Allows guests to choose a date and submit a booking request.
Registration and Login: Enables guests to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profiles.

RSVP Management: Guests can view and edit their RSVP status, guest count, and meal preferences.

Admin Dashboard: Accessible only to admins, this dashboard allows management of bookings and RSVPs.

State Management: Managed using Reactâ€™s built-in hooks.


3.2. Back-End (Express + Node.js):

Handles API requests, business logic, and communicates with the database.Booking Routes:
POST /api/bookings: Allows guests to submit a booking request.
GET /api/bookings: Allows admins to retrieve and view all booking requests.
PUT /api/bookings/:id: Allows admins to approve or reject bookings.

User Routes:
POST /api/users/register: Allows guests to register an account.
POST /api/users/login: Handles user login, returning a JWT for authentication.
GET /api/users/profile: Allows guests to retrieve their profile, RSVP status, and preferences.
PUT /api/users/profile: Allows guests to update their profile, RSVP, and meal preferences.

Admin Routes:
GET /api/admin/bookings: Allows admins to view all bookings.
GET /api/admin/rsvps: Provides a summary of all guest RSVPs, guest counts, and meal preferences.
POST /api/admin/notifications: Allows admins to send notifications or updates to guests.


3.3. Database (MongoDB):MongoDB will store all relevant data, including user information, bookings, and RSVPs.
Key Collections:
Users Collection:
Stores user profiles (e.g., name, email, hashed password).
